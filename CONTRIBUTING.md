Contributions will not currently be accepted until I implement a contributer agreement.

I intend to use pislam in my own projects and/or potentially license it to third
parties under a non-restrictive license. For these reasons copyright assignment will
be manditory.

If you would like to make a substancial contribution and copyright assignment is not
an option, please contact me. carlchatfield@gmail.com
